# AppControl

*Read this in [French](README.md) for the full narrative.*

**AppControl is an operational platform for IT resilience.** Built for production teams running mission-critical applications where availability, regulatory traceability and controlled restart are not negotiable: banks, insurance, telecoms, energy, healthcare, critical operators, integrators, MSPs.

It sits **across five families of existing tools** — supervision, CMDB, scheduler, hypervisor, container orchestrator — without replacing any. It adds the layer they were never designed to provide: the *application*, in motion, as a runnable artifact.

## What it does

- **Dependency maps** — model applications as DAGs (strong / weak dependencies), visualised in React Flow
- **Sequenced operations** — start, stop, restart in DAG order, parallelism within levels
- **3-level diagnostics** — health (process alive?), integrity (data consistent?), infrastructure (OS / prereqs OK?)
- **DR switchover** — 6-phase site failover with rollback at any phase
- **Append-only audit** — DORA-compliant logs for every action, state transition, configuration change
- **Scheduler integration** — REST + `appctl` CLI for Control-M, AutoSys, $Universe, TWS
- **MCP-native** — talk to your production from Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any MCP-compatible client

## DORA compliance

Regulation 2022/2554, effective 17 January 2025. AppControl directly addresses **Articles 8** (mapping), **11** (continuity testing), **12** (reconstruction), **16** (incident records), **25** (cyber scenarios). Penalties: up to **2 % of annual global revenue** for the entity, up to **€1M** for executives personally.

See the [French README](README.md#dora--pas-du-confort-une-obligation) for the full *Article → mechanism* table.

## Design safeguards

A platform that *can* stop production *can* break it. AppControl answers by construction, not by procedure: granular 5-level RBAC per application, advisory mode (observe without executing), dry-run on every action, optional PR-only mode (start/stop via merged pull request), mTLS everywhere, append-only audit (no UPDATE, no DELETE, ever). Each application picks its autonomy level (observation → diagnostics → operations → drill → DR) and can step back at any time.

## Three engagement modes

Same product, three angles:

- **Application rebuild** — pilot a 12–24-month modernization program: target DAG modelling, component-by-component validation, clean restarts throughout, regulatory audit delivered at exit.
- **DORA / NIS2 compliance** — append-only signed audit trail as native output, no replacement of the existing ops stack.
- **24/7 on-call enablement** — operators at 3 AM get an immediate application map, controlled restart in the right DAG order, automatic audit — one console to open.

## Tech stack

Rust 1.88+ (agent, gateway, backend) · PostgreSQL 16 or SQLite · React 18 / TypeScript / Vite · mTLS everywhere · Docker + Helm + OpenShift compatible · on-prem, private cloud or full air-gap.

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — Docker Compose (Linux / macOS)

```bash
gh release download --repo xcomponent/appcontrol-release --pattern 'docker-compose.release.yaml'
APPCONTROL_VERSION=latest docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yaml up -d
open http://localhost:8080
```

Login: `admin@localhost` / `admin`.

### Option 2 — Standalone PowerShell (Windows / Linux, no Docker)

```powershell
mkdir AppControl; cd AppControl
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/xcomponent/appcontrol-release/raw/main/appcontrol.ps1" -OutFile appcontrol.ps1

.\appcontrol.ps1 install
.\appcontrol.ps1 start
.\appcontrol.ps1 add-site Production
.\appcontrol.ps1 add-site DR-Site
```

Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell Core 6+ (Linux/macOS).

### Option 3 — CLI only (`appctl`)

```bash
gh release download --repo xcomponent/appcontrol-release --pattern 'appctl-linux-amd64' --dir /usr/local/bin
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/appctl-linux-amd64 && mv /usr/local/bin/appctl-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/appctl

export APPCONTROL_URL=http://localhost:3000
appctl login --email admin@localhost --password admin
appctl start core-banking --wait --timeout 120
appctl switchover core-banking --target-site lyon --mode FULL --wait
```

## Docker Images
