## Agent issues

### Agent will not connect to gateway

!!! note "Symptom"
    The Agents page shows the agent as `UNREACHABLE`. No heartbeat events are received. `systemctl status appcontrol-agent` reports the binary is running.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Are reconnection attempts visible in the agent journal?
sudo journalctl -u appcontrol-agent --since "5 min ago" | grep -E "connect|gateway|tls"

# 2. Can the agent host reach the gateway TCP port?
nc -vz gateway.example.com 4443

# 3. Does the TLS handshake succeed?
openssl s_client -connect gateway.example.com:4443 \
  -cert /etc/appcontrol/tls/agent.crt \
  -key /etc/appcontrol/tls/agent.key \
  -CAfile /etc/appcontrol/tls/ca.crt -showcerts < /dev/null
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Network firewall blocks 4443 | Open outbound TCP 4443 from the agent subnet to the gateway |
| Wrong gateway URL | Edit `/etc/appcontrol/agent.yaml`, fix `gateway.url` or `gateway.urls`, `systemctl reload appcontrol-agent` |
| DNS resolution failure | `getent hosts gateway.example.com` — if empty, fix `/etc/resolv.conf` or `/etc/hosts` |
| Gateway pod down | `kubectl get pods -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway`; restart if needed |
| `tls_insecure: false` against self-signed gateway cert | Use a CA-signed gateway cert, or set `gateway.tls_insecure: true` (dev only) |

### Enrollment fails

!!! note "Symptom"
    `appcontrol-agent --enroll …` exits non-zero. Returns HTTP 401, 409, or 500.

**Resolution:**

| HTTP code | Cause | Fix |
|----------:|-------|-----|
| 401 | Token invalid or revoked | Generate a new token: `appctl pki create-token --name <n> --max-uses 1 --scope agent` |
| 409 | Token `max_uses` exhausted | Generate a new token with a higher `max_uses` |
| 410 | Token expired | Generate a new token; defaults to 24 h validity |
| 500 | PKI not initialized | `appctl pki init --org-name "<your org>"` |
| Connection refused | Gateway unreachable | Verify `https://gateway:4443/health` is reachable; check the gateway pod |
| `Certificate verify failed` | Agent presented a wrong CA | Re-run enrollment which writes the fresh CA to `/etc/appcontrol/tls/ca.crt` |

See [Agent Installation §8](AGENT_INSTALLATION.md#8-troubleshooting) for the full enrollment-error table.

### Heartbeat timeout (components flip to `UNREACHABLE`)

!!! warning "Symptom"
    Components managed by an apparently healthy agent transition to `UNREACHABLE` periodically. The agent process is up but the backend marks it stale.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Confirm the agent is still sending heartbeats
sudo journalctl -u appcontrol-agent | grep -i heartbeat | tail -10

# 2. Compare the configured timeout
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT name, heartbeat_timeout_seconds FROM organizations;"

# 3. Check connection latency between agent and gateway
sudo journalctl -u appcontrol-agent | grep -E "rtt|latency" | tail -5
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Network is dropping idle WebSocket connections | Reduce keep-alive interval on the load balancer to < 60 s; or raise heartbeat frequency |
| `heartbeat_timeout_seconds` too low for the network | `UPDATE organizations SET heartbeat_timeout_seconds = 300;` (default is 180 s) |
| Backend `heartbeat_monitor` is over-aggressive | Check backend logs for `marking agent stale` — verify clock skew with NTP |
| Agent log shows repeated `pong timeout` | A firewall is killing idle WS frames — switch the gateway to port 443 (passes as HTTPS) |

### Certificate expired

!!! danger "Symptom"
    Agent journal shows `certificate has expired` or `unable to get local issuer certificate`. The agent does not reconnect.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check the agent cert expiry
openssl x509 -in /etc/appcontrol/tls/agent.crt -noout -dates

# Check the CA cert expiry
openssl x509 -in /etc/appcontrol/tls/ca.crt -noout -dates
```

**Resolution:**

1. Generate a new enrollment token: `appctl pki create-token --name renewal --max-uses 1 --scope agent`.
2. Stop the agent: `sudo systemctl stop appcontrol-agent`.
3. Re-enroll: `sudo appcontrol-agent --enroll https://gateway:4443 --token ac_enroll_...`.
4. Start the agent: `sudo systemctl start appcontrol-agent`.

If the CA itself expired, see [Disaster Recovery — CA loss](DISASTER_RECOVERY.md).

### Advisory mode — agent reports but does not execute

!!! note "Symptom"
    Operator clicks **Start** but nothing happens on the host. The map updates check status but no command runs.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Is the application or agent in advisory mode?
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, name, settings->>'mode' FROM applications WHERE id = '<app_id>';"

# 2. Check the action log — operations should be recorded even if no-op
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT action_type, details FROM action_log WHERE target_id='<app_id>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Application is in `advisory` mode | Toggle to `operate` mode in **Settings > Application > Mode** |
| Component has `is_optional=true` and was skipped | Inspect the sequencer log; flip `is_optional=false` if required |
| User has only `view` permission | Grant `operate` permission via the Share dialog |

---

## Gateway issues

### Gateway down

!!! danger "Symptom"
    All agents in a zone go `UNREACHABLE` at once. The gateway pod is crash-looping or not reachable.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Pod state
kubectl get pods -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway

# 2. Logs
kubectl logs -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway --tail=100

# 3. Health endpoint (from outside the cluster)
curl -k https://gateway.example.com:4443/health
# Returns: ok agents=42 backend=connected buffer_msgs=0 buffer_bytes=0
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Backend WebSocket URL wrong | Edit `BACKEND_URL` env var, must end with `/ws/gateway` |
| TLS cert / key mismatch | Verify file paths and `openssl rsa -in gateway.key -modulus` matches the cert |
| Listening port already taken | Check `ss -tlnp | grep 4443`; change `LISTEN_PORT` if conflicting |
| OOM kill | Increase `resources.limits.memory` in the Helm values |

### mTLS handshake failure

!!! warning "Symptom"
    Gateway logs show repeated `tls handshake failure` or `unknown ca`. Agents cannot connect.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# From the agent host, simulate the full handshake
openssl s_client -connect gateway.example.com:4443 \
  -cert /etc/appcontrol/tls/agent.crt \
  -key /etc/appcontrol/tls/agent.key \
  -CAfile /etc/appcontrol/tls/ca.crt -verify_return_error

# Compare the issuer fingerprint of the gateway's chain and the agent's CA
openssl x509 -in /etc/appcontrol/tls/ca.crt -noout -fingerprint -sha256
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Gateway and agent use different CAs | Re-enroll the agent against the current backend PKI |
| Gateway cert SAN does not include the DNS the agent uses | Reissue the gateway cert with the right DNS SANs |
| Clock skew > 5 min | Sync NTP on both ends; certs are sensitive to clock drift |
| `TLS_ENABLED=false` on one side | Verify both gateway and agent have `tls.enabled: true` |

### Rate-limited

!!! note "Symptom"
    Gateway returns HTTP 429 on `/enroll`, or per-agent log spam shows "rate limit exceeded".

**Resolution:**

```bash
# 1. Identify the offending agent
kubectl logs -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway | grep "rate limit" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c

# 2. The agent is likely sending too many CheckResults — investigate why deltas are flapping
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT component_id, count(*) FROM check_events
  WHERE created_at > now() - interval '5 minutes'
  GROUP BY component_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

If the rate is legitimate (large cluster of components on one agent), raise the per-agent rate limit in the gateway config; otherwise fix the flapping `check_cmd`.

---

## Backend issues

### 5xx errors

!!! danger "Symptom"
    The frontend shows "Internal Server Error". `curl /api/v1/apps` returns HTTP 500/502/503.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Backend pod state
kubectl get pods -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=backend
kubectl logs -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=backend --tail=200

# 2. Database reachability
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- \
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/ready

# 3. Recent panics
kubectl logs -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=backend | grep -E "panicked|FATAL|thread"
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| DB unreachable | See [DB pool exhausted](#db-pool-exhausted) and `/ready` |
| Panic on startup (insecure JWT in production) | Set a 32+ char `JWT_SECRET` via `openssl rand -base64 48` |
| Missing migration | Check `kubectl logs` for `sqlx::migrate` errors; investigate the partial migration |
| Unhandled JSON deserialization error | Capture the request payload, file a bug report |

### DB pool exhausted

!!! warning "Symptom"
    Backend logs show `acquire timeout` or `pool timed out while waiting for an open connection`. P95 latency spikes.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Current pool size and utilization
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- \
  curl -s localhost:3000/metrics | grep db_pool

# 2. Long-running queries in PostgreSQL
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, state, query
  FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < now() - interval '2 seconds'
  ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Long-running query holds a connection | Identify the query, add an index, or rewrite |
| Pool too small | Raise `DB_POOL_SIZE` (default 20; rule of thumb: 10 + apps × 0.5, capped at 50) |
| Idle connection timeout > LB idle timeout | Set `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` below the LB idle limit (e.g. AWS ALB = 350) |
| Connection leak in a custom handler | Review recent backend changes for missing `drop` on a tx |

### Slow queries

!!! note "Symptom"
    P95 API latency above 2 s. Specific endpoints (`/apps`, `/applications/:id`) feel sluggish.

**Diagnosis:**

```sql
-- Identify the slowest queries
SELECT
  substring(query, 1, 80) AS query,
  calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 15;

-- Check check_events partition sizes
SELECT
  inhrelid::regclass AS partition,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(inhrelid)) AS size
FROM pg_inherits WHERE inhparent = 'check_events'::regclass
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(inhrelid) DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `check_events` partition not pruned | Set `RETENTION_CHECK_EVENTS_DAYS=90` and let background task drop old partitions |
| Missing index on a custom query | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` then `CREATE INDEX` |
| Sequential scan on `state_transitions` | Verify `idx_state_transitions_component_created` exists |
| Tablespace fragmentation | `VACUUM ANALYZE state_transitions;` (off-hours) |

### `JWT_SECRET` insecure panic

!!! danger "Symptom"
    Backend exits at startup with `FATAL: JWT_SECRET must be set to a strong value in production`.

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Generate a strong secret
NEW=$(openssl rand -base64 48)

# Update the Kubernetes secret
kubectl create secret generic appcontrol-jwt \
  --namespace appcontrol \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret="$NEW" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Restart the backend
kubectl rollout restart -n appcontrol deployment/appcontrol-backend
```

Note: rotating `JWT_SECRET` invalidates **all** active sessions — users must log in again.

### CORS rejects browser request

!!! note "Symptom"
    The browser console shows `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`.

**Resolution:**

`CORS_ORIGINS` must explicitly list the frontend origin in production. Example:

```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=https://appcontrol.example.com,https://admin.example.com
```

In development (`APP_ENV=development`), an empty `CORS_ORIGINS` is permissive. In production, an empty value rejects **all** cross-origin requests by design.

---

## Authentication issues

### OIDC discovery failed

!!! warning "Symptom"
    Backend logs `failed to fetch OIDC discovery document`. Login redirect returns 500.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Verify the discovery URL is reachable from the backend
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- \
  curl -sv https://keycloak.example.com/realms/appcontrol/.well-known/openid-configuration

# 2. Check the variable is set
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- env | grep OIDC
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Wrong URL | Fix `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` (the realm path matters) |
| Network egress blocked | Allow egress from the backend pods to the IdP |
| Self-signed IdP cert | Mount the IdP's CA into the backend container's trust store |

### SAML assertion invalid

!!! warning "Symptom"
    SAML POST to `/api/v1/auth/saml/acs` returns `invalid signature` or `assertion expired`.

**Diagnosis:**

Inspect the SAMLResponse with [https://samltool.com](https://samltool.com) (paste the base64 from the network tab).

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Wrong IdP signing cert | Re-fetch and base64-encode the IdP cert into `SAML_IDP_CERT` |
| Clock skew | Sync NTP; SAML enforces a 5-min `NotBefore`/`NotOnOrAfter` window |
| `SAML_WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED=true` but IdP sends unsigned assertion | Either enable signed assertions in IdP or set the env var to `false` (not recommended) |
| `SAML_SP_ACS_URL` mismatch | The IdP's "Reply URL" must equal exactly the backend ACS URL |

### API key expired

!!! note "Symptom"
    Scheduler integration receives HTTP 401 with `key expired`.

**Resolution:**

```bash
# 1. Identify the offending key
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT id, name, expires_at FROM api_keys
  WHERE user_id = '<user_id>' AND expires_at < now();"

# 2. Create a new key via the UI or API; copy the plaintext immediately
curl -X POST https://appcontrol.example.com/api/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"scheduler-2026-q2","expires_in_days":365}'

# 3. Update the scheduler configuration with the new key
```

### "Forbidden" on a resource you should own

!!! warning "Symptom"
    User has been granted `manage` on an application but still gets HTTP 403.

**Diagnosis:**

```sql
-- What permissions does the user have (direct + team)?
SELECT permission_level, source FROM (
  SELECT permission_level, 'direct' AS source FROM app_permissions_users
  WHERE user_id = '<uid>' AND app_id = '<aid>' AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > now())
  UNION ALL
  SELECT pt.permission_level, 'team:' || t.name FROM app_permissions_teams pt
  JOIN team_members tm ON tm.team_id = pt.team_id
  JOIN teams t ON t.id = pt.team_id
  WHERE tm.user_id = '<uid>' AND pt.app_id = '<aid>'
    AND (pt.expires_at IS NULL OR pt.expires_at > now())
) x;
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Permission has `expires_at` in the past | Update or remove the `expires_at` |
| Team membership missing | Add the user to the team |
| Workspace restriction excludes the site | Add the user (or their team) to a workspace that includes the site |
| Stale JWT cached | User signs out and back in to refresh claims |

---

## FSM issues

### Component stuck in `STARTING`

!!! warning "Symptom"
    The map shows a component blue-pulsing in `STARTING` for minutes. The sequencer waits forever.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Is the start command still running on the host?
ssh <host> ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep "<expected process>"

# 2. Latest health check
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT exit_code, stdout, duration_ms, created_at
  FROM check_events
  WHERE component_id = '<cid>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `start_cmd` returned but process actually died | Fix the start command; ensure the process daemonizes correctly |
| `check_cmd` checks a different process | Realign check and start commands |
| `start_timeout_seconds` too short | Raise it on the component config (default 120 s) |
| Health check polled too infrequently | Sequencer polls every 3 s during transitions — usually fine; if not, file a bug |

### Stuck in `UNREACHABLE` after agent reconnect

!!! note "Symptom"
    Agent reconnects and heartbeats again, but its components remain `UNREACHABLE`.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# 1. Check the last 5 state transitions
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT previous_state, next_state, trigger, created_at
  FROM state_transitions WHERE component_id='<cid>'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# 2. Force a fresh health check
curl -X POST https://appcontrol.example.com/api/v1/components/<cid>/check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Resolution:**

The FSM expects a fresh `CheckResult` to leave `UNREACHABLE`. Trigger a manual check (above). If the issue recurs, see [Runbook 1](RUNBOOKS.md#runbook-1-agent-not-connecting).

### State oscillates between `RUNNING` and `FAILED`

!!! danger "Symptom"
    A component flips state every 30 s. Operators see "flapping" alerts.

**Diagnosis:**

```sql
-- Inspect recent transitions
SELECT previous_state, next_state, trigger, created_at, details
FROM state_transitions WHERE component_id = '<cid>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Inspect recent check results
SELECT exit_code, duration_ms, substring(stdout, 1, 80) AS stdout
FROM check_events WHERE component_id = '<cid>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `check_cmd` is non-deterministic | Make the check idempotent and stable |
| Timeout on check | Raise the agent-level command timeout; default is `check_interval_seconds` |
| Resource exhaustion on host | Inspect CPU/RAM; the host may be killing the process under load |
| Race between two agents managing the same process | Verify one agent per component; remove duplicates |

---

## Operation issues

### Start times out

!!! warning "Symptom"
    A start operation runs the configured `start_cmd` but never completes. The orchestrator marks the operation timed-out.

**Resolution:**

1. Inspect the action log: `SELECT * FROM action_log WHERE target_id='<app_id>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`.
2. The `details` JSON shows which component failed and the timeout that triggered.
3. Common fix: raise `start_timeout_seconds` on the offending component (default 120 s).
4. If many components share the same issue, raise the app-level timeout in **Settings > Operations**.

### Stop hangs

!!! note "Symptom"
    A stop operation is stuck — components remain in `STOPPING`.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Is the stop process still running?
ssh <host> ps -ef | grep "<process>"

# Did the agent receive the command?
sudo journalctl -u appcontrol-agent | grep -E "ExecuteCommand|stop" | tail -5
```

**Resolution:**

- The component's `stop_cmd` may be waiting for graceful shutdown that never completes. Use the **Force Stop** action in the UI, which sends `kill -9` after the timeout.
- If `stop_timeout_seconds` is too short, raise it on the component (default 60 s).

### Sequencer suspends mid-DAG

!!! note "Symptom"
    Start operation runs the first DAG levels successfully then halts. UI shows "Operation suspended — operator intervention required".

**Resolution:**

The sequencer **suspends** (rather than cancels) on a component failure to give operators a chance to fix the underlying issue without losing in-flight progress. Two next steps:

1. Inspect the failed component, fix the root cause (often a missing prereq or a bad command).
2. Resume the operation from the UI ("Resume" button) or via API: `POST /api/v1/operations/:id/resume`.

If you cannot resume, cancel the operation: `POST /api/v1/operations/:id/cancel` and start fresh.

### Error branch not detected

!!! note "Symptom"
    A component fails, but the "Restart error branch" button targets only the failed component — not its downstream dependents.

**Resolution:**

The error-branch algorithm walks **downstream** (dependent of failed → dependent of dependent…). If your topology has weak coupling that AppControl does not yet treat as dependencies, the dependents are not reached.

- Verify the `dependencies` rows for the failed component: `SELECT to_component_id FROM dependencies WHERE from_component_id = '<failed_cid>';`.
- If a dependency is missing, add it via the map editor (drag an edge between components).

### Dry-run says OK but actual run fails

!!! warning "Symptom"
    `appctl start <app> --dry-run` reports a clean plan. The same operation without `--dry-run` fails.

**Resolution:**

Dry-run validates:

- DAG (cycles, missing references)
- Permissions
- Agent connectivity
- Command syntax (presence, not semantics)

Dry-run does **not** execute commands, so it cannot detect:

- Wrong credentials in `start_cmd`
- Missing prerequisites on the host (port already in use, disk full)
- Race conditions between components

For tighter pre-flight validation, run the diagnostic engine (Level 3) before a critical operation: `appctl diagnose <app> --level 3`.

---

## Discovery / auto-discovery noise

!!! note "Symptom"
    Auto-discovery surfaces hundreds of irrelevant processes (cron jobs, OS daemons), making the draft topology unusable.

**Resolution:**

Discovery is heuristic. Two ways to tame it:

1. **Filter at the agent** — set `APPCONTROL_DISCOVERY_EXCLUDE` in the agent's environment to a comma-separated deny-list. Matching is case-insensitive and uses prefix semantics, so `crond` also suppresses `crond-worker` etc. Example: `APPCONTROL_DISCOVERY_EXCLUDE=crond,rsyslogd,sshd`. The deny-list is read on every discovery scan (no agent restart needed if the variable is exported in the systemd unit and the agent is restarted, or if the variable is sourced from `/etc/environment`).
2. **Curate in the UI** — discovery presents a draft topology; uncheck any process you do not want before promoting it to an application.

If discovery produces no signal at all, check that the agent has permission to read `/proc` (Linux) or `tasklist` (Windows). Container agents may need `--pid=host` to see host processes.

---

## Cluster (fan-out) sync issues

!!! warning "Symptom"
    A fan-out cluster shows divergent member states or a parent state that does not reflect members.

**Diagnosis:**

```sql
-- Are all members reporting check results?
SELECT cm.hostname, cms.current_state, cms.last_check_at
FROM cluster_members cm
LEFT JOIN cluster_member_state cms ON cms.cluster_member_id = cm.id
WHERE cm.component_id = '<cid>' AND cm.is_enabled = true;

-- Does the parent component's state match the policy?
SELECT id, name, cluster_mode, cluster_health_policy, cluster_min_healthy_pct, current_state
FROM components WHERE id = '<cid>';
```

**Resolution:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Member's `agent_id` is wrong | Update `cluster_members.agent_id`; verify the agent is reachable |
| `cluster_health_policy = threshold_pct` but `cluster_min_healthy_pct` too high | Lower the threshold or fix the failing members |
| Member's `check_cmd_override` is wrong | Test the override on the host; correct as needed |
| Member's `is_enabled = false` is skipping live nodes | Re-enable: `UPDATE cluster_members SET is_enabled = true WHERE id = '<mid>';` |

---

## DR switchover stuck in phase X

!!! danger "Symptom"
    A switchover starts but stays in phase 1–6 for an unusually long time.

**Resolution by phase:**

| Phase | Likely cause | Fix |
|------:|--------------|-----|
| 1 (Prepare) | Target site agents not connected | `kubectl logs gateway-dr ...`; reconnect agents |
| 2 (Validate) | Pre-flight health check failed on target | Inspect `switchover_log.details`; fix the failing component |
| 3 (StopSource) | Source component's `stop_cmd` hangs | Raise `stop_timeout_seconds`, or "force stop" |
| 4 (Sync) | Data replication lag exceeds threshold | Wait for replication, or trigger an emergency sync |
| 5 (StartTarget) | Target component fails to start | Fix the host issue, then resume |
| 6 (Commit) | Database write contention | Should never linger; if it does, file a bug report |

Inspect:

```sql
SELECT phase, status, started_at, ended_at, details
FROM switchover_log
WHERE application_id = '<aid>'
ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

To force-cancel (only before phase 6): `POST /api/v1/apps/:id/switchover/cancel`. See [Runbook 6](RUNBOOKS.md#runbook-6-dr-switchover-stuck-in-phase).

---

## Diagnostic + Rebuild rejected

!!! warning "Symptom"
    `POST /api/v1/apps/:id/rebuild` returns HTTP 409 `rebuild_protected`.

**Resolution:**

The rebuild engine refuses to touch any component flagged `rebuild_protected = true`. This is intentional protection for databases of record and other irreplaceable components.

Options:

1. Rebuild the application **excluding** the protected components — pass `exclude_component_ids` in the rebuild request body.
2. Temporarily unprotect a component (requires `manage` permission):

```sql
UPDATE components SET rebuild_protected = false WHERE id = '<cid>';
```

Re-protect after the rebuild finishes. The change is recorded in `config_versions`.

---

## How to file a bug report

When opening an issue, attach the following so the maintainer can reproduce:

### 1. Environment

```bash
# Version of every component
appctl version
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- /app/appcontrol-backend --version
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-gateway -- /app/appcontrol-gateway --version
appcontrol-agent --version

# Database flavor
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"
```

### 2. Logs (last 200 lines from each)

```bash
kubectl logs -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend --tail=200 > backend.log
kubectl logs -n appcontrol -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway --tail=200 > gateway.log
sudo journalctl -u appcontrol-agent --since "1 hour ago" > agent.log
```

### 3. Configuration (redact secrets)

```bash
# Backend env (redact JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL password)
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-backend -- env | grep -E '^[A-Z_]+=' | grep -v -E 'SECRET|PASSWORD|KEY|DATABASE_URL'

# Gateway YAML
kubectl exec -n appcontrol deploy/appcontrol-gateway -- cat /etc/appcontrol/gateway.yaml

# Agent YAML
cat /etc/appcontrol/agent.yaml
```

### 4. Minimal reproduction

A 3-step recipe that triggers the bug on a fresh `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.release.yaml up -d` install. If the bug requires a specific application topology, attach the JSON export from **Settings > Application > Export**.

### 5. Database state (optional, helpful)

```sql
-- Component, last 5 transitions, last 5 check events
SELECT id, name, current_state FROM components WHERE id = '<cid>';
SELECT previous_state, next_state, trigger, created_at FROM state_transitions
  WHERE component_id = '<cid>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT exit_code, substring(stdout, 1, 100), created_at FROM check_events
  WHERE component_id = '<cid>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### 6. File log paths reference

| Component | Log path (Linux) | Log path (Kubernetes) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Agent | `journalctl -u appcontrol-agent` | n/a (runs outside K8s) |
| Gateway | `journalctl -u appcontrol-gateway` (when on a VM) | `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway` |
| Backend | n/a (typically Kubernetes) | `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=backend` |
| Frontend (nginx) | `/var/log/nginx/` inside the container | `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=frontend` |
| PostgreSQL | `/var/log/postgresql/` | depends on managed-service provider |
